## Superstition

My research has two focal points: the causes of effects and the effects of causes. 

### Why does superstition arise within a highly atheist government?

My preliminary research reveals that bureaucrats, under fierce competition, are more likely to commit superstition in the face of uncertainty in the case of China. 

### What effects does superstition have on the policy outcomes?

This is an ongoing research, one that analyzes the alignment of Fengshui principles in urban planning; the other examines the dates in key projects based on "superstition" belief.
