Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Political Science at [Northwestern University](https://polisci.northwestern.edu/). My research interest includes bureaucracy, religion, with a regional focus on China.

Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.A. in Translation from [Beijing Foreign Studies University](http://www.bfsu.edu.cn/). I received my M.A. in Political Science from [Columbia University](https://polisci.columbia.edu/).

You can find my CV [here]([#](jianandu.github.io/assets/resume_new.pdf).
